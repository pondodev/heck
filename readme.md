# heck

because sometimes writing c can be heck, but it doesn't have to be.

## what is heck?

you ever find yourself writing some stuff and copy pasting it over to every single project you do? i know i have, and
it's kinda annoying! especially since to bring those improvements over to all my projects requires that i copy my
changes around everywhere, and i'm super lazy.

enter: heck.

this is really just a personal c library i'll add to over time as i see the need. i don't really intend for this to be
some big library to fit everyone's needs, but if you find use in it then i'm real glad :)

## usage

TODO

## features

list to come!
